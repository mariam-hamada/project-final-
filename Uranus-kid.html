        <pre id="p1">
                     William Herschel, a skilled musician residing in 18th century England, was not only known for his musical talents
                 but also for his deep curiosity. His fascination with the night sky led him to embark on astronomical studies using a 
                 telescope of his own construction, alongside his brother Alexander and sister Caroline. 
                 
                 In 1781, they made history by<strong> discovering the planet Uranus </strong> - the first such discovery since ancient times 
                 and the inaugural planetary finding through a telescope. 

                 Despite an unsuccessful attempt to name it Georgium Sidus after King George III, this celestial body was 
                 eventually named Uranus <em>after the Greek god of the sky</em>, following suit with other planets being named after deities.

         <b>Size:</b> 32,000 miles (51,000 kilometers). Uranus is the third largest planet in the solar system.
         About 63 Earths could fit inside Uranus.
         <b>Gases:</b> Mainly hydrogen and helium. Small amounts of the gas methane give Uranus a blue-green 
         color. Underneath its huge layers of gases, the planet has a smaller area of thick, hot liquid.
         <b>Rings:</b>Thin, narrow rings made of ice and rocks. The rings that surround Uranus are very dark.
         They reflect about as much light as charcoal.
         <b>Structue and Surface:</b> Uranus is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made of flowing 
         icy materials above a solid core.
         <b>Time on Uranus:</b>Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side. and it spins the opposite direction 
         as Earth and most other planets

        <pre id="p3">
            Uranus, the seventh planet of the Solar System, has 28 known moons. Most of them are named after characters that appear in, or are mentioned in, the works
        of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus's moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons <em>ex:juliet</em>, five major moons, and ten irregular moons.
        The inner and major moons all have prograde orbits and are cumulatively classified as regular moons. In contrast, the orbits of the irregular moons are distant, highly 
        inclined, and mostly retrograde.
        William Herschel discovered the first two moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787. The other three ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and
        Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five may be in hydrostatic equilibrium, and so would be considered dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit
        about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.

          Imagine Ariel, one of Uranus's moons, as a magical palace made entirely of ice 
    crystals. Deep within its frozen halls resides a powerful enchantress, weaving spells
    to protect the moon and its inhabitants from the icy cold of space. Only those with pure 
    hearts and adventurous spirits can brave 
    the journey to seek her wisdom.

          Titania, the largest moon of Uranus, is said to be home to a mystical garden where
    dreams come to life. In this enchanted realm, flowers bloom in every color of the rainbow, 
    and gentle streams flow with liquid diamonds. It is said that anyone who visits Titania's
    Garden of Dreams will find inspiration and courage to pursue their greatest desires.
