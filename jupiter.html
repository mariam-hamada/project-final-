        <p class="p-ju"> Jupiter was the first planet to form,
            and its inward migration during the
            primordial Solar System impacted much
            of the formation history of the other planets.
            Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume),
            followed by helium, which makes up a quarter of its mass
            and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of
            Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun.
            Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer
            mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen, and a diffuse inner core
            of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours,
            Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid: it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator.
            The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence
            and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great RedSpot,
            a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="p-ju">
            Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere,
            the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere).
            Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four
            large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
            Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the
            second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.

        <p class="p-ju">
            Since 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes:
            seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.

        <p class="p-ju">
            In both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations,
            Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine pantheon:
            Zeus to the Greeks and Jupiter to the Romans.[17] The International
            Astronomical Union formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976,
            and has since named its newly discovered satellites for the god's lovers,
            favourites, and descendants.[18] The planetary symbol for Jupiter,
            descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, ⟨Ƶ⟩,
            as an abbreviation for Zeus.

        <br>

        <p class="p-ju">
            n Latin, Iovis is the genitive case of Iuppiter, i.e. Jupiter.
            It is associated with the etymology of Zeus ('sky father').
            The English equivalent, Jove, is only known to have come
            into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[21]

        <p class="p-ju">
            Jovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial,
            employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean 'happy' or 'merry',
            moods ascribed to Jupiter's influence in astrology.
            The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, which is used to form
            some Jupiter-related words, such as zenographic.[c]
