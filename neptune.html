            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun. It is the fourth-largest
                planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It
                is
                17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than fellow ice giant Uranus. Neptune is denser
                and
                physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its
                atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The
                planet
                orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion
                kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical
                symbol
                ♆, representing Neptune's trident</p>

            <p>Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System that was found from
                mathematical predictions derived from indirect observations rather than being initially observed by
                direct
                empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that
                its
                orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the
                position of
                Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier.
                Neptune was subsequently directly observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846[1] by Johann Gottfried
                Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered
                shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 15 known moons were located telescopically
                until
                the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a small apparent size, making it challenging
                to
                study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25
                August
                1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited it.[18][19] The advent of the Hubble Space
                Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has allowed for additional detailed
                observations from afar.</p>

                <p id="transform" >The average distance between Neptune and the Sun is 4.5 billion km (about 30.1
                    astronomical units (AU)),
                    and
                    it completes an orbit on average every 164.79 years, subject to a variability of around ±0.1 years.
                    The
                    perihelion distance is 29.81 AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33 AU.[i]

                    On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full barycentric orbit since its discovery in
                    1846,[123]
                    although it did not appear at its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a
                    different
                    location in its 365.26 day orbit. Because of the motion of the Sun in relation to the barycentre of
                    the
                    Solar System, on 11 July Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to the
                    Sun; if
                    the
                    more common heliocentric coordinate system is used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12
                    Neptune's
                    orbital eccentricity is only at 0.008678. This makes it the planet in the Solar System with the
                    second
                    most
                    circular orbit after Venus.[127] The orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77° compared to that of Earth.

                <p id="transform2">
                    The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°,[128] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars
                    (25°).
                    As a
                    result, Neptune experiences seasonal changes similar to those on Earth. The long orbital period of
                    Neptune
                    means that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[107] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is
                    roughly
                    16.11
                    hours.[11] Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day
                    over
                    the
                    course of its long year is not any more extreme.
